JavaScript
	>Module Pattern:
		It is a commonly used Design Pattern which is used to wrap a set of variables and functions together in a single scope.
	
	Ex:

function EmployeeDetails() {
  var name: "Mayank";
  var age = 30;
  var designation = "Developer",
  var salary = 10000;


  
  return {
    name: name,
    age: age,
    designation: designation
  }
}

var newEmployee = EmployeeDetails()

// This will result in "undefined" value
var userName = newEmployee.salary;
