JavaScript
	>ES6:
	ECMAScript (ES) is a scripting language specification standardized by ECMAScript International.
	 It is used by applications to enable client-side scripting.
	 The specification is influenced by programming languages like Self, Perl, Python, Java etc. Languages like JavaScript, Jscript and ActionScript are governed by this specification.
	
	ES6 Class:
	In ES6,Classes can be included in the code either by declaring them or by using class expressions.
	
	Syntax: Declaring a Class
 	class Class_name {  
}

	Syntax: Class Expressions
var var_name = new Class_name {  
} 


	Ex.1: Declaring a class
class Polygon { 
   constructor(height, width) { 
      this.height = height; 
      this.width = width; 
   } 
}

	Ex.2: Class Expression
var Polygon = class { 
   constructor(height, width) { 
      this.height = height; 
      this.width = width; 
   } 
}
The above code represents an unnamed class expression. A named class expression can be written as.

var Polygon = class Polygon { 
   constructor(height, width) { 
      this.height = height; 
      this.width = width; 
   } 
}
