JavaScript
	>Polymorphism:
	  The polymorphism is a core concept of an object-oriented paradigm that provides a way to perform a single action in different forms.
 	  It provides an ability to call the same method on different JavaScript objects.

	Ex:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<script>
class A
  {
     display()
    {
      document.writeln("A is invoked");
    }
  }
class B extends A
  {
  }
var b=new B();
b.display();
</script>

</body>
</html>
